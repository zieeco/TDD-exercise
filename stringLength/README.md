# Task 1: stringLength

Write a function `stringLength` that takes any string as an argument and returns its characters count.

```javascript
stringLength('string') // returns '6'
```

Also, expand your function to make it check if the string is at least 1 character long and not longer than 10 characters. Throw errors if those conditions are not met.

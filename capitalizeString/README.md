# Task 3: Capitalize a String

write a function called `capitalizeString` that takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized.!

```javascript
capitalizeString('microverse') // returns 'Microverse'
```


Also, you should not capitalize the first letter of the string if it's already capitalized.
